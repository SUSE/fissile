## fissile build layer stemcell

Builds a Docker layer that is the base for all images

### Synopsis



This command creates a docker image to be used as a base layer for all role images,
similar to BOSH 'stemcells'.

Fissile will create a Dockerfile and a directory structure with all dependencies in 
`<work-dir>/base_dockerfile`. After that, it will build an image named 
`<repository>-role-base:<FISSILE_VERSION>`.
