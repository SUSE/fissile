## fissile build layer compilation

Builds a docker image layer to be used when compiling packages.

### Synopsis



This command creates a container with the name `<repository>-cbase-<FISSILE_VERSION>` 
and runs a compilation prerequisites script within. 

Once the prerequisites script completes successfully, an image named 
`<repository>-cbase:<FISSILE_VERSION>` is created and the created container is 
removed.

If the prerequisites script fails, the container is not removed. 
If the compilation base image already exists, this command does not do anything.
